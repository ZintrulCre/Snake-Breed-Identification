Description
Milk snakes grow to 20 to 60 inches (51 to 152 cm) in total length (including tail). They have smooth and shiny scales and their typical colour pattern is alternating bands of red-black-yellow or white-black-red. However, red blotches instead of bands are seen in some populations. Some milk snakes have a striking resemblance to coral snakes and this mimicry (known as Batesian mimicry) likely scares away potential predators. Both milk snakes and coral snakes possess transverse bands of red, black and yellow. Experts now recognize that common mnemonics which people use to distinguish between the deadly coral snake and the harmless milk snake are not 100% reliable. Some coral snakes do not have the typical banding colours or patterns. Examples of unreliable mnemonics commonly used:
