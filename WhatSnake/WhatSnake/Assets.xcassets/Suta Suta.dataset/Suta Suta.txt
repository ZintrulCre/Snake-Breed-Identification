Description
The typical length of the curled snake is 40 cm (16 in), although it has been known to reach lengths of 60 cm (24 in) or more. It has a wide head and is dark brown or reddish brown in colour, with a distinctively darker head and paler under the flanks. The light-coloured iris and small pupil are distinctive features of this species. S. suta also has a temporal dark-edged stripe (typically orange in colour) that extends around from each eye to the snout. Sometimes, the edges of the vertebral scales can be darker, resulting in a reticulated pattern from which the Latin name suta, meaning "stitched", is derived.
Distribution and Habitat
The suta suta distribution map
The curl snake can be found in all states and territories of Australia excluding Tasmania. It typically occurs in arid eastern and central Australia. In Victoria, it occurs only in the north and central regions, and in Western Australia, it is restricted to the far north-eastern boundaries. It most commonly inhabits grasslands, scrublands, and open woodlands, foraging amongst leaf litter and under rocks at night. It can be found occupying old burrows, in soil cracks, under woody debris, and under leaf litter.
Venom
The suta suta venom is neurotoxic and considered unsafe especially to small children. Bites from large specimens are considered especially dangerous. If bitten, one should seek medical advice immediately, immobilise the patient, and apply a pressure bandage.
