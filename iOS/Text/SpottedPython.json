    "name": "Spotted Python",
    "venomous": true,
    "distribution": "NSW, QLD",
    "description": "Adults average about 100–140 centimetres (39–55 in) in length. It has an irregular, blotched colour pattern throughout its life. The blotches have ragged edges because the dark pigmentation occurs only on complete scales. Found in Australia from the extreme north of the Cape York Peninsula, south through eastern Queensland to northern New South Wales. Also on many islands off the coast of Queensland. The type locality given is Queensland, Australia. Antaresia maculosa has also been recorded from the southern Trans-Fly region of Papua New Guinea, at Weam in Western Province and there are concerns it may be being exploited for the pet trade across the border in Indonesian West New Guinea. Found in most types of habitats, but prefers rocky hillsides and outcrops with crevices and caves. The Papua specimen was found behind discarded corrugated tin sheets beside a disused airstrip in Eucalypt savanna-woodland habitat dotted with numerous termite mounds."
