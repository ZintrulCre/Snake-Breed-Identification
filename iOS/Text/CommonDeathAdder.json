{
    "name": "Common Death Adder",
    "venomous": true,
    "distribution": "QLD, VIC, NSW, SA",
    "description": "The common death adder has a broad flattened, triangular head and a thick body with bands of red, brown and black with a grey, cream or pink belly. It can reach a maximum body length of 70–100 centimetres (2.3–3.3 ft). Death adders possess the longest fangs of any Australian snake. Unlike the common or European adder (Vipera berus), the common death adder is a member of the snake family Elapidae, rather than the family Viperidae, which are not found in Australia. The common death adder occurs over much of eastern and coastal southern Australia – Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. It is more scarce in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and the west parts of South Australia. It is also native to Papua New Guinea. Common death adders are found in forests, woodlands, grasslands and heaths of the eastern coast of Australia. The death adder is a master of camouflage, due to its band stripes, hiding beneath loose leaf litter and debris in woodland, shrubland and grassland. The common death adder venom contains a highly toxic neurotoxin which can cause paralysis or even kill. It can deliver the fastest strike among all venomous snakes recorded in Australia. Human death can occur within six hours after the bite."
