Description
Mulga snakes are large, venomous snakes growing up to 2.5 to 3.0 m (8.2 to 9.8 ft) in length in the largest specimens, although 1.5 m (4.9 ft) is a more typical length for an average adult. It is exceeded in length among venomous snakes only by the Asiatic king cobra, some species of African mambas, genus Lachesis (bushmasters) of the American neotropics, and the Australian taipan. A good-sized adult mulga snake of 2.0 to 2.5 m (6.6 to 8.2 ft) length can weigh 3 to 6 kg (6.6 to 13.2 lb), and mulga snakes are often heavier than the co-occurring taipans. The colour of the snakes differs from area to area within their range; they can be a light brown colour in the desert to a dark, brown-blackish colour in the cooler regions of Queensland, South Australia, and New South Wales. This snake is robust, with a wide head and smooth snout.
Distribution and habitat
Mulga snakes occur in most states of Australia except for Tasmania. Its range includes all of the Northern Territory, most parts of Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia. It may also be found in the western parts of the Australian Capital Territory. Mulga snakes inhabit woodlands, hummock grasslands, chenopod scrublands, and almost bare gibber or sandy deserts, usually sheltering near humans under timber, rubbish piles, burrows, and deep soil cracks. They are not found in rainforests.
Venom
The mulga snake accounted for 4% of identified snakebite victims in Australia between 2005 and 2015, with no deaths recorded. The last recorded death occurred in 1969, when a 20 year old man was bitten while reaching around for a packet of cigarettes under his bed in Three Springs, Western Australia.
