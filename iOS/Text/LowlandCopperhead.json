    "description": "The lowland copperhead is generally 1-1.5 m (3–4½ feet) long. Their colour varies a great deal, from a coppery mid-brown to yellowish, reddish, grey or black. The copper head colouring that gave rise to the common name is not always present. Its venom has been measured at 0.5 mg/kg subcutaneous. It is found in southeastern Australia, including Tasmania. A. superbus has a preference for areas of low vegetation near water bodies where it hunts for frogs, lizards and snakes including smaller snakes of its own species, but has been found in sandstone ridgetop woodland around Sydney although such habitat is also usually near water bodies. The Venom of lowland copperhead contains postsynaptic neurotoxins. There have been a dozen reported bites from this species and one fatality."
