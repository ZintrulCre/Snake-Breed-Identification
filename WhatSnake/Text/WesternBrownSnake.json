    "name": "Western Brown Snake",

    "distribution": "NSW, VIC, NSW, SA, NT, TAS",
    "description": "The western brown snake grows up to 1.8 m (5.9 ft) in total length (including tail). Its back can feature shades of orange-brown with flecks and bands, or appear plain. Its belly is cream to orange with pink blotches. Some individuals have jet blackheads (this can cause it to be confused with the black-headed python), while others feature a black 'V' shape on the back of their neck, below their head. The western brown has a wide distribution and is found across most of the Australian continent, including all of the Northern Territory, as well as most of Queensland, Western Australia, and some of Victoria. The western brown is a ground-dwelling snake which prefers drier habitats but is also found in coastal eucalypt forests, woodlands, and grasslands. Although the western brown is not an arboreal species, it is not uncommon for it to climb small shrubs or trees. It also hides in crevices and under rocks, and in urban areas can be found under rubbish or in piles. Although the western brown snake's venom is not the most toxic in the brown snake genus, its average delivery contains a relatively high quantity of venom, and thus the western brown snake has high potential to deliver a deadly bite. Its venom contains neurotoxins, nephrotoxins, and a procoagulant, although humans are not usually affected by the neurotoxins. The bite is usually painless and difficult to see due to their small fangs. Human symptoms of a western brown snake bite are a headache, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, severe coagulopathy, and sometimes kidney damage. In dogs and cats, paralysis is also likely to occur."
